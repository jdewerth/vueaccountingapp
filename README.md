# Vue SPA Accounting App

> This is a sample SPA app I started working on while learning to build Vue single page applications. This app was never finished but has some basic functionality such as the ability to register an entity through stripe connect and then proceed with identity verification. I also built a RESTful API with Laravel that this app consumes. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
